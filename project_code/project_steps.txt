here are the detailed steps to make a wireless charging circuit for vehicles with an LCD display, relay coil, current sensor, ultrasonic sensor, induction coil, and Arduino Uno:

Gather all the necessary components and tools:

Components:

Arduino Uno board
Induction coil
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
Relay module
Current sensor (INA219)
LCD display (16x2)
Resistors (220 Ohm and 10k Ohm)
Capacitors (100uF and 10uF)
Jumper wires


Tools:

Soldering iron
Solder wire
Breadboard
USB cable (to connect Arduino to PC)

Connect the components to the Arduino Uno board as follows:

Connect the positive (+) pin of the induction coil to the NC (Normally Closed) pin of the relay module
Connect the negative (-) pin of the induction coil to the COM (Common) pin of the relay module


Relay module:

Connect the VCC pin of the relay module to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the GND pin of the relay module to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the IN pin of the relay module to pin 10 of the Arduino Uno board


Ultrasonic sensor:

Connect the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the GND pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the TRIG pin of the ultrasonic sensor to pin 9 of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the ECHO pin of the ultrasonic sensor to pin 8 of the Arduino Uno board


Current sensor:

Connect the VCC pin of the current sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the GND pin of the current sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the SDA pin of the current sensor to pin A4 of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the SCL pin of the current sensor to pin A5 of the Arduino Uno board


LCD display:

Connect the VSS pin of the LCD display to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the VDD pin of the LCD display to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the V0 pin of the LCD display to the center pin of a 10k Ohm potentiometer
Connect one end of the potentiometer to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the other end of the potentiometer to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the RS pin of the LCD display to pin 2 of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the RW pin of the LCD display to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the E pin of the LCD display to pin 3 of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the D4-D7 pins of the LCD display to pins 4-7 of the Arduino Uno board
Connect the LED+ pin of the LCD display to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno board through a 220 Ohm resistor
Connect the LED- pin of the LCD display to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno board
